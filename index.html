        <tr>
          <th>Ingredients</th>
          <th>Quantity</th>

    <p class="paragrphs">
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> First you have to toast your bread. To toast your
      bread, put the bread in a toaster until it pops out. (I don't know how to
      use a toaster...) If you don't have a toaster like I do, use your air
      fryer! Put your two slices of bread on a pan and place the pan in your air
      fryer.
    </p>
    <p class="paragrphs">
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> While your bread is toasting, place a small,
      round pot on the stove and set the stovetop temperature to the medium
      temperature (anything in-between really really hot and not cooking at
      all.)
    </p>
    <p class="paragrphs">
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Put a very small slice of butter in the pan.
      Swirl it around the pan with a spatula or just by holding the handle and
      letting the butter hit every side of the pot, so your food won't stick.
    </p>
    <p class="paragrphs">
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> While your pot is heating up with the butter,
      crack the eggs in a small bowl and whip them up until they are scrambled.
    </p>
    <p class="paragrphs">
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Pour the scrambled eggs onto the hot pan and stir
      with spatula until you see its all cooked. (Make sure the eggs are fully
      cooked, you don't want to get salmonella!)
    </p>
    <p class="paragrphs">
      <strong>Step 6:</strong> Scrape your eggs off the pot and put your cooked
      eggs on a plate so they don't burn, and turn off your stove.
    </p>
    <p class="paragrphs">
      <strong>Step 7:</strong> Next, take out your toasted (hopefully not burnt)
      toast. You may have taken your toast out before your eggs were done and
      thats okay, everyone has their preferences!
    </p>
    <p class="paragrphs">
      <strong>Step 8:</strong> Transfer your eggs into your bread slices and
      voila! An egg and cheese sandwich.
